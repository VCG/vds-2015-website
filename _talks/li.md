bio: |
   Feifei Li is an associate professor at the School of Computing,
   University of Utah. He obtained his B.S. in computer engineering from
   Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2002 (transferred from
   Tsinghua University, China) and PhD in computer science from Boston
   University in 2007. His research focuses on the scalability,
   efficiency, and effectiveness issues,  as well as security problems in
   database systems and big data management.  He was a recipient for an
   NSF career award in 2011, two HP IRP awards in
   2011 and 2012 respectively, a Google App Engine award in 2013, the
   IEEE ICDE best paper award in 2004, the IEEE ICDE 10+ Years Most
   Influential Paper Award in 2014, a Google Faculty award in 2015, and
   the SIGMOD Best Demonstration Award in SIGMOD 2015. He is/was the demo
   chair for VLDB 2014, general chair for SIGMOD 2014, PC area chair for
   ICDE 2014 and SIGMOD 2015, and associate editor for IEEE TKDE.

    How to store, process, and analyze large heterogeneous data is a fundamental challenge. In particular, it is important to support interactive analysis over such data, while reducing query latency and improving system throughput. We extend the concept of online aggregation to online analytics, and enable the support for interactive query conditions as well. Our goal is to provide query and analytical results continuously from the start of the query and analytical task execution, while providing quality guarantees and refining the query accuracy throughout the query execution. We implemented our system based on both traditional relational database engine and NoSQL system. When exact results are required for interactive query execution over big data, we introduce an in-memory interactive query and analytical engine based on Spark SQL that supports rich query semantics and analytics through both SQL and DataFrame APIs.
