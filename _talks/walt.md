    From a wider perspective, Data Science be seen as the management and interpretation of data through computation and statistics. This tutorial highlights several of these core elements through an interactive computational workshop. To work with data, we need to access a data source, whereafter the data can be visualized to explore its structure. Based on intuitions gained about this structure, exploratory statistical analyses can then be made. Finally, more sophisticated machine learning models can be ﬁt to the data to draw inferences and make predictions about data yet unseen. This tutorial systematically leads attendees through these steps by way of practical, real-world examples, augmented by hands-on computations in the Python language.
