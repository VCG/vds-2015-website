bio: |
    Jeffrey Heer is an Associate Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, where he directs the Interactive Data Lab and conducts research on data visualization, human-computer interaction and social computing. The visualization tools developed by his lab (D3.js, Vega, Protovis, Prefuse) are used by researchers, companies and thousands of data enthusiasts around the world. His group's research papers have received awards at the premier venues in Human-Computer Interaction and Information Visualization (ACM CHI, ACM UIST, IEEE InfoVis, IEEE VAST, EuroVis). Other awards include MIT Technology Review's TR35 (2009), a Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship (2012), and a Moore Foundation Data-Driven Discovery Investigator award (2014). Jeff holds BS, MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from UC Berkeley (whom he then betrayed to go teach at Stanford from 2009 to 2013). Jeff is also a co-founder of Trifacta, a provider of interactive tools for scalable data transformation.
abstract: |
   While visualizations are often used to convey research results or tell data-driven stories, they can also be powerful tools for discovery. General visualization tools typically require manual specification of views: analysts must select data variables and then choose which transformations and visual encodings to apply. While well-suited to answering targeted questions, this interaction model may impose a tedious specification process that impedes broad consideration of the data, particularly in the early stages of analysis. In this talk, I will present our work designing tools for more comprehensive and efficient data exploration. Our primary approach is to develop mixed-initiative systems for steerable, interactive browsing of recommended visualizations, chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures.
